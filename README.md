# i3-pomodoro
Simple Pomodoro scripts to be used in i3 with i3blocks

## Installation

Insert the scripts wherever you have write rights.
I use the directory structure found in this repository.

After adding the lines of the [i3/config](./.config/i3/config) and [i3/i3blocks.conf](./.config/i3/i3blocks.conf), reload i3.

## Usage

Now you should be able to start Pomodoro via `$mod + p`.
A notification will pop up and i3blocks will show a small text with the current pomodoro mode.
